			The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards<br></p>
		<p>THE DEAL:
			The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal
			first.
			Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.<br></p>

		THE PLAY: Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts
		them,
		face down, on the bottom of his stack.

		<p>If the cards are the same rank, it is War.<br><br>
			Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up.
			The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards).
			If the turned-up cards are again the same rank,
			each player places another card face down and turns another card face up.<br><br>
			The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.</p>

		<p>HOW TO KEEP SCORE:
			The game ends when one player has won all the cards.</p>
