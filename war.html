The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards<br></p>
<p>THE DEAL:
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first.
 Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.<br></p>

THE PLAY: Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, 
face down, on the bottom of his stack.<br><br>

If the cards are the same rank, it is War.<br><br>
Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. 
The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). 
If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, 
each player places another card face down and turns another card face up.<br><br> 
The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
<br><br>
HOW TO KEEP SCORE:
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
